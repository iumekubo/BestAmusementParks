			<p class="recommend">Lets begin with Disneyland, Incredicoster is a wonderful coaster. It is a launch coaster 
			and has one loop, with the theme of the movie Incredibles 2. Next their is Legoland with the Dragon. It is a classic
				coaster, with a Lego dragon theme. At Universal Studios, there is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey which is a
				part simulation, part coaster. It is a Harry Potter themed attraction with 4-D like experiences. Tatsu at six flags
			is a wonderful thrill ride. This dragon themed ride is a hanging coaster that flips you on your belly so it feels 
				like you are flying. Knott's Berry farm has a classic wooden coaster called ghost rider, that is very fast and 
			thrilling. </p> <width= "50%">
